# Project: Can you unscramble a blurry image? 

### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

## SRGAN
### SRGAN1
This folder include mainly the generated images by only **generator** part of the srgan model in [srgan_init](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN1/srgan_ginit) and the corresponding model weights in [checkpoint](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN1/checkpoint).

### SRGAN2
This folder include the generated images by the total **srgan** model.

[checkpoint](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN2/checkpoint) includes the train result of model. `d_srgan.npz` and `g_srgan.npz` are two core parts of the model at this stage.

[srgan_gan](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN2/srgan_gan) includes sample images during the train process.

[test_bicubic](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN2/test_bicubic) includes the images generated by `bicubic`.

[test_init](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN2/test_init) includes the images generated by `initialization` part of the `srgan` model.

[test_srgan](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/tree/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN2/test_srgan) includes the images generated by `srgan` model

[result_index](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/blob/Fei-Zheng/output/SRGAN2/result_index.txt) is the loss and indexes changes during the train process
