# Project: Super-resolution of low resolution images 

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The images in the test_set/HR are super-revolutioned images from low-revolution ttraining images.
